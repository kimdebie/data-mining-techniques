## Data files

There are several files in the data folder. Some of them are not included in the repository due to their size, but these are created through running *code/main.py* (except the original assignment files). The most relevant files are described here.

* The files provided with the assignment are *training_set_VU_DM.csv* and *test_set_VU_DM.csv*. They can be obtained from the Kaggle website linked above.
* The file *testfile.csv* simply contains the first 1000 rows from *training_set_VU_DM.csv* and can be used for quick testing of newly written functions.
* The file *testing_set.csv* is the test set that is to be used for all versions of the models.
* The file *downsampled_training_set.csv* is the training set that has been downsampled; *upsampled_training_set.csv* is the training set that has been upsampled; the file *full_training_set.csv* is the original, untreated training set.
